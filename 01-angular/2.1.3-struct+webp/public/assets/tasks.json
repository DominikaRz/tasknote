The animation should be funny and relatively short (about 5 min).\n\n1 scene \nThe first view of the object is showing how huge is the spaceship (make it big, and in the reality it is small). Camera show 180 degrees angle to show it better, then move to the main scene \n2 scene\nThe spaceship is floating above the street, some cars are driving below. Then there is the light and the car is starting to lift up. Here can be view from side of the ship, and from the bottom of the car, but around the car is nothing but green light, so the right size of ship is not visible\n3 scene\nThe car was abducted and the ship wants to leave the place, but there is an error (some light is now red not green in the ship). Camera is now rotate and we see that the car is cucked from the roof to the ship, and is not fitting in the UFO.\n4 scene\nTry to lift it again few more times, but the outcome is the same. There is frustration shown in the ship.\n5 scene 1 proposition\nThe car is getting smaller after some tries and fit. Then the ship is flying away. That’s the end\n5 scene 2 proposition\nTry to get another car with the same result. Then give up and try to lift some mouse that is shown at the street ",
